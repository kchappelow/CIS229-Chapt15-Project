#Chapter 15 Project

Racing Car

Write a Java program that simulates car racing, as shown in Figure 15a. The car moves from left to right. When it hits the right end, it restarts from the left and continues the same process. You can use a timer to control animation. Draw the car with a new base coordinates (x, y), as shown in Figure 15b. Also let the user increase/decrease the car speed by pressing the CTRL+ and CTRL- keys.

		
##Tasks
* Code: Write a program to solve the problem.
* Can you draw the car correctly?
* Is the car moving?
* Is the car moving circulary?
* Does the speed increase and decrease with the CTRL+ and CTRL- keys?
* Submit your program and UML diagram using git.
